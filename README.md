# AddressBook

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This should work if you have Angular cli installed. If not, it can be installed by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`
